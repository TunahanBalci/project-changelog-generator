## Changelog Generator

While programming, sometimes we can forget what we changed in the code before we commit into Github. 
This can lead to decreased efficiency.

As this is a problem that I faced personally, I decided to write a basic python script that makes it possible to note what we changed.
### Showing Various Types

You can add changelogs in 3 types: "Created", "Edited" and "Deleted".

### Local Storage

Tracks changelogs and saves changes to a local storage. Every added change is  **editable** inside the program.

### HTML Changelog Reports

Generates a simple, nice looking changelog report from the existing changes.
